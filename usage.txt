# System Usage Guide

This guide explains how to operate the mmWave Simulator UI and its security features.

## Basic Operation

1.  **Start the System**:
    - Click the green **"CAMERA ON"** button to start the simulation and camera feed.
    - The status bar will change to "Status: CAMERA ON".

2.  **ATM Interaction**:
    - **Insert Card**: Drag the virtual ATM card (bottom right) into the card slot.
    - **Enter PIN**: Use the keypad to enter a 4-digit PIN (any 4 digits work for simulation). Press **ENTER**.
    - **Withdraw Cash**: Enter an amount and press **ENTER**.
    - **Eject Card**: Click the **"EJECT CARD"** button or wait for the transaction to finish.

## Security Features

### 1. Hidden Weapon Detection
*Detects dangerous objects like guns, knives, or skimmers.*

- **Activation**: Click the **"Weapon: OFF"** button in the top control panel to toggle it to **"Weapon: ON"** (Red).
- **How it works**: The system uses an AI model to scan the video feed for weapons.
- **Trigger**: If a weapon is detected with high confidence:
    - A red box highlights the weapon on the screen.
    - The screen border flashes red.
    - A voice alert announces "Warning. Weapon detected."
- **System Response**:
    - The ATM immediately **LOCKS** ("SYSTEM LOCKED").
    - The card is automatically **ejected**.
    - A safety alert overlay appears: "POTENTIAL THREAT DETECTED. ARE YOU SAFE?".
    - An emergency alarm sounds.

### 2. Peeking Detection
*Detects suspicious behavior from others while a user is transacting.*

- **Activation**: Automatically active whenever a **card is inserted** in the ATM.
- **How it works**: The system tracks the body pose of all individuals in view.
- **Triggers**:
    - **Side Peeking**: A person's face is detected peering from the extreme edges of the camera frame.
    - **Shoulder Surfing**: A person stands suspiciously close (behind) the active user.
- **System Response**:
    - A warning appears on the video feed: "WARNING: PEEKING (SIDE)" or "WARNING: PEEKING (BEHIND)".
    - If the behavior persists, the system pauses the transaction and asks: "SOMEONE IS WATCHING YOU? CONTINUE TRANSACTION?".
    - You can choose to **"CONFIRM SAFE"** to continue or **"EMERGENCY ALERT"** to trigger the alarm.

### 3. "Hands Up" Detection
*Detects if a person is being coerced or held up.*

- **Activation**: Always active during simulation.
- **How it works**: The system analyzes body language to detect if a person has their hands raised above their head.
- **Trigger**: Both wrists are detected above the eyes.
- **System Response**:
    - Displays "THREAT: HANDS UP" on the screen.
    - Flashes the screen border red.
    - Triggers a voice alert and the safety confirmation screen.

## View Modes

Use the dropdown menu in the control panel to change how the system visualizes data:
- **Full Debug**: Shows all detection boxes, skeletons, and debug info.
- **Standard Monitoring**: A cleaner view for general surveillance.
- **Privacy Mode**: Blurs faces to protect identity.
- **Security Mode**: High-contrast mode focused on threat detection.
