# Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.
- **Git**: (Optional) To clone the repository.

## Installation

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**
    If you haven't already, download the project files to a local directory.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    # Windows
    python -m venv venv

    # macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Note: This project uses `torch` and `ultralytics`. The installation might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.*

## Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application window ("mmWave Simulator UI") should appear.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application entry point containing the UI logic.
- `mmwave_simul.py`: Simulator logic for mmWave sensor data.
- `atm_card.py` & `atm_keypad.py`: Components for the ATM simulation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `*.pt`: Pre-trained YOLO models used for detection.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Models**: If the application fails to load model files (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`), ensure they are present in the root directory. The `ultralytics` library may attempt to download them automatically if missing.
- **Camera Issues**: The application uses `cv2` to access the webcam. Ensure your camera is connected and not being used by another application.
